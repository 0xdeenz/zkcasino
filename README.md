# zkcasino
A decentralized casino where you can keep your wins (and losses) private, powered by zk-SNARKs.


### Acknowledgements 
The whole project aims to further extend on the [Zero Knowledge Lottery](https://killari.medium.com/zero-knowledge-lottery-437e456dc3f2) protocol proposed by [@Qhuesten](https://twitter.com/qhuesten). The circuits are based on the [original implementation](https://github.com/KillariDev/ZK-Lottery-Circuits), while the smart contracts adapt those of Cyclone Currency (mixing service that should not be named) Nova.
