# zkcasino
A decentralized casino where you can keep your wins (and losses) private, powered by zk-SNARKs.

An oddly familiar feel to the now defunct protocol called something like _'Cyclone Currency'_, this time with a twist:

>The house can take your money, in a cryptographically sound and provably fair way.

### Acknowledgements 
The whole project aims to further extend on the [Zero Knowledge Lottery](https://killari.medium.com/zero-knowledge-lottery-437e456dc3f2) protocol proposed by [@Qhuesten](https://twitter.com/qhuesten). The circuits are based on the [original implementation](https://github.com/KillariDev/ZK-Lottery-Circuits), while the smart contracts adapt those of Cyclone Currency (mixing service that should not be named) Nova.

### Disclaimers
In case of an investigation by any federal entity or similar, this is a simple software project aimed to explore the applications of zero knowledge proofs and expand on their use cases. The autonomous smart contracts (that could not qualify as a legal person) will only be deployed on test networks with FAKE funds.
